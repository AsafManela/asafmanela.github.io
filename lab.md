# Lab

I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing students and to learn a lot from them.
Our projects are usually at the intersection of financial economics and cutting-edge technology (e.g. AI, LLMs, crypto).
I provide them with guidance and resources like data and compute so that they can succeed in pursuit of their research goals.
We work hard and share the belief that *research is life!*
